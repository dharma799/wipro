Countdown Timer: Write a script that uses a while loop to countdown from 10 to 1, printing each number on a new line, and then displays "Boom!" when the countdown reaches zero.


#!/bin/bash

# Set the starting time (seconds)
time_to_count=10

# Loop through the countdown
while [[ $time_to_count -ge 1 ]]; do
  # Print the remaining time on a new line
  echo "$time_to_count"
  # Decrement the time counter
  ((time_to_count--))

  # Introduce a one-second delay (modify as needed)
  sleep 1
done

# Display the final message
echo "Boom!"


User Input Validation: Create a script that prompts the user to enter a positive number. Use a while loop to continuously prompt the user until a positive number is entered.


#!/bin/bash
# Function to validate user input
validate_number() {
  local number="$1"
  # Check if the input is a number and greater than zero
  if [[ ! -z "$number" && "$number" -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Valid positive number entered: $number"
    return 0  # Indicate successful validation (exit code 0)
  else
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a positive number."
    return 1  # Indicate invalid input (exit code 1)
  fi
}

# Loop until a valid number is entered
while true; do
  read -p "Enter a positive number: " number

  # Call the validation function and check its return code
  if validate_number "$number"; then
    break  # Exit the loop if validation is successful
  fi
done
echo "You have entered a valid positive number."



File Processing: Write a script that reads each line from a file named data.txt and displays each line preceded by a line number, using a while loop.


#!/bin/bash

# Define the filename
file_name="data.txt"

# Check if the file exists
if [ ! -f "$file_name" ]; then
  echo "Error: File '$file_name' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Loop through each line in the file
line_number=1
while read -r line; do
  # Print line number and content
  echo "$line_number: $line"
  ((line_number++))  # Increment line number for the next iteration
done < "$file_name"

echo "Finished processing file."


Directory Traversal: Create a script that traverses through all files in a directory and its subdirectories, displaying the name and size of each file.


#!/bin/bash

# Function to process files
process_file() {
  local filename="$1"
  # Check if it's a regular file (avoid directories or special files)
  if [[ -f "$filename" ]]; then
    # Get file size in human-readable format
    file_size=$(stat -c "%s" "$filename")  # Use stat command with %s for size
    echo "$filename: $file_size bytes"
  fi
}

# Function to traverse directory recursively
traverse_directory() {
  local directory="$1"
  # Loop through all entries in the directory
  for entry in "$directory"/*; do
    # Check if it's a directory (avoid processing the current directory)
    if [[ -d "$entry" && "$entry" != "." ]]; then
      # Recursively traverse subdirectories
      traverse_directory "$entry"
    else
      # Process the file (call the process_file function)
      process_file "$entry"
    fi
  done
}

# Get the directory path from the user (optional)
# read -p "Enter directory path (or use current directory): " directory

# Default to the current directory if no input provided
directory="${1:-$PWD}"

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$directory" ]; then
  echo "Error: Directory '$directory' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

# Start the directory traversal
echo "Processing files in '$directory':"
traverse_directory "$directory"



Menu System: Implement a simple menu system using a while loop, where the user can select options such as "Add", "Delete", "View", and "Exit". The loop should continue until the user chooses to exit.


#!/bin/bash

# Function to display the menu
display_menu() {
  echo "Menu:"
  echo "1. Add"
  echo "2. Delete"
  echo "3. View"
  echo "4. Exit"
}

# Main loop
while true; do
  # Display the menu
  display_menu

  # Read user choice
  read -p "Enter your choice (1-4): " choice

  # Validate and handle user choice
  case $choice in
    1) echo "Add operation selected (not implemented yet)";;
    2) echo "Delete operation selected (not implemented yet)";;
    3) echo "View operation selected (not implemented yet)";;
    4) echo "Exiting..."; break;;
    *) echo "Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.";
  esac
done

echo "Goodbye!"




Password Validation: Write a script that prompts the user to enter a password. Use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user until a valid password (e.g., at least 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters) is entered.


#!/bin/bash

# Minimum password length
min_length=8

# Password complexity requirements (modify as needed)
require_upper=1  # At least one uppercase letter
require_lower=1  # At least one lowercase letter
require_number=1  # At least one number
require_special=1  # At least one special character

# Function to check password complexity
check_complexity() {
  local password="$1"
  # Check password length
  if [[ ${#password} -lt $min_length ]]; then
    echo "Password must be at least $min_length characters long."
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for uppercase letter (modify regex pattern as needed)
  if [[ $require_upper -eq 1 && ! [[ "$password" =~ [A-Z] ]] ]]; then
    echo "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)."
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for lowercase letter (modify regex pattern as needed)
  if [[ $require_lower -eq 1 && ! [[ "$password" =~ [a-z] ]] ]]; then
    echo "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z)."
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for number (modify regex pattern as needed)
  if [[ $require_number -eq 1 && ! [[ "$password" =~ [0-9] ]] ]]; then
    echo "Password must contain at least one number (0-9)."
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for special character (modify regex pattern as needed)
  if [[ $require_special -eq 1 && ! [[ "$password" =~ [~!@#$%^&*_] ]] ]]; then
    echo "Password must contain at least one special character (~!@#$%^&*_) ."
    return 1
  fi

  # Password meets all requirements
  return 0
}

# Loop until a valid password is entered
while true; do
  # Prompt the user for password (consider using read -s for hidden input)
  read -p "Enter a strong password: " password

  # Validate the password complexity
  if check_complexity "$password"; then
    continue  # Loop back if password is invalid
  fi

  # Password is valid, exit the loop
  echo "Valid password entered."
  break
done



Process Monitoring: Create a script that continuously monitors a specific process (identified by its name or PID) using a while loop. Display a message if the process stops running.
Downloading Files: Write a script that downloads multiple files from a list of URLs stored in a file named urls.txt. Use a while loop to read each URL from the file and download the corresponding file using wget or curl.


#!/bin/bash

# Get the process name or PID (modify as needed)
process_name="myprocess"  # Replace with the actual process name
# process_pid=12345  # Uncomment and replace with the PID if using PID

# Function to check process status
check_process() {
  local process_id="$1"
  # Use ps to check if the process is running
  if [[ $(ps -eo pid | grep -q "$process_id") -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "Process '$process_name' (PID: $process_id) is not running!"
  fi
}

# Choose between checking by name or PID (comment out unused lines)
if [[ -n "$process_name" ]]; then
  process_id=$(pgrep -f "$process_name")  # Get PID by process name
  check_process "$process_id"
else
  check_process "$process_pid"  # Use provided PID
fi

# Monitor the process continuously
while true; do
  sleep 5  # Adjust the sleep time as needed (check every 5 seconds)
  # Check the process status again in the loop
  if [[ -n "$process_name" ]]; then
    process_id=$(pgrep -f "$process_name")
    check_process "$process_id"
  else
    check_process "$process_pid"
  fi
done




Input File Existence Check: Implement a script that prompts the user to enter the name of a file. Use a while loop to check if the file exists in the current directory. If the file does not exist, prompt the user to enter the filename again.


#!/bin/bash

# Loop until a valid filename is entered
while true; do
  # Prompt the user for the filename
  read -p "Enter the name of a file: " filename

  # Check if the file exists
  if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
    echo "File '$filename' exists."
    break  # Exit the loop if the file is found
  else
    echo "Error: File '$filename' does not exist. Please try again."
  fi
done




Backup Script: Create a backup script that continuously monitors a directory for changes using a while loop. Whenever a new file is added to the directory, the script should automatically create a backup of that file in a separate directory.

#!/bin/bash


source_dir="$1"
backup_dir="$HOME/backups"

create_backup() {
  local filename="$1"
  local backup_file="$backup_dir/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)_$filename"
  cp "$source_dir/$filename" "$backup_file"
  echo "Backup created: $backup_file"
}

if [ ! -d "$source_dir" ]; then
  echo "Error: Directory '$source_dir' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -d "$backup_dir" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
  echo "Backup directory created: $backup_dir"
fi


source_files=$(ls -t "$source_dir")  # Get most recent files first


while true; do
 
  current_files=$(ls -t "$source_dir")

  
  diff --new <(echo "$source_files") <(echo "$source_files") | grep -v '^$' | while read -r new_file; do
    create_backup "$new_file"  # Create backup for each new file
  done

  
  source_files="$current_files"


  sleep 1
done
